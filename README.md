# Bouncing_Ball

**Description:**

     This HTML webpage combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive animation. It features a gray container holding 50 colorful bouncing balls. JavaScript variables control ball properties like color, position, and velocity, while the "getRandom(scale)" function adds randomness to their initial settings. The "makeball()" function dynamically generates and appends balls to the container. The "update()" function orchestrates the animation, continuously updating ball positions, handling boundary collisions, and simulating gravity effects. The "create(n)" function initiates the creation of the 50 balls, and the animation loop refreshes every 100 milliseconds, providing users with a captivating and dynamic visual experience as the balls move and interact within the container.
**How to run code:**

     step1:-Save the HTML file with .html extension.
     step2:-"Go Live" button at the bottom right corner of the VSCode window.
     Click the "Go Live" button.
     step4:-A new browser window will open, displaying  Bouncing_Ball animation.
**Future improvement:**

     For future improvement, consider adding user interaction features, such as the ability to click and drag balls, change their properties, or add physics-based interactions like collisions between the balls, creating a more engaging and interactive animation experience.
